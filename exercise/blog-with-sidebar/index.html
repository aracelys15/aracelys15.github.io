                     <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
                        <sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or
                        <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed
                         in some tree species,
                        in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
                        forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> 
                        The phenomenon is 
                        most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs 
                        between trees of different species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> 
                        There exist many 
                        hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and 
                        research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating 
                        insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
            
                <h3>Possible physiological explanations</h3>
                <p>
                    The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
                    <sup>[6]</sup>
                    The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 
                    1920s.<sup>[9]</sup>
                    The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might 
                    suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, 
                    an example of convergent evolution.<sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup>
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
                    leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy areas 
                    suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds; 
                    the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies 
                    suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by 
                    neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
                    <sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns 
                    are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually 
                    fill the canopy gaps.
                    <sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness 
                    between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite 
                    that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this 
                    pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early 
                    succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral 
                    movement.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[12]</sup>
                     According to this theory, variable flexibility in 
                    lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.

                <h3>Benefits of crown shyness</h3>
                <p>
                    As with animals, plants also compete for resources - 
                    including nutrients, water, space and light - to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In forested areas with dense canopies there is intense c
                    ompetition between plants for light. It is possible that 
                    gaps in the canopy resulting from crown shyness allows trees
                    to increase their exposure to light and optimise the process 
                    of photosynthesis. 
                </p>  
            <h3>Is wind the only cause of crown shyness?</h3>
            <p>
                If abrasion is the primary cause of crown shyness, you would 
                expect it to be more pronounced among trees in windy locations 
                than those growing in sheltered spots. But this was found to 
                not be the case in a study of trees in the Monteverde Cloud 
                Forest Reserve in Costa Rica. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This cloud forest is frequently subjected to high winds - they regularly 
                exceed 100 kilometres per hour in some places during winter. Little difference 
                was found in the crown shyness of trees in windy areas compared to more 
                sheltered ones.
