            <br>
        <li>1cup/200 grams granulated sugar</li>
            <br>
        <li>½teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <br>
        <li>2large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <br>
        <li>1tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <br>
        <li>2¼cups/285 grams cake flour</li>
            <br>
        <li>2teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <br>
    <h4>For the frosting</h4>
        <li>1cup/30 grams freeze-dried raspberries, finely 
            ground in a food processor or spice grinder</li>
            <br>
        <li>1cup/225 grams
            unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature</li>
             <br>
        <li>2cups/245 grams confectioners’ sugar</li>
            <br>
        <li>1teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <br>
    <h4> Preparation</4>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>
            Make the cookies: In a large bowl, using a spoon, cream 
            the butter, cream cheese, sugar and salt until smooth 
            and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and 
            whisk to incorporate some air and to dissolve the 
            sugar crystals, about 1 minute. Stir in the flour 
            and baking powder until just incorporated.
        </p> 
            <br>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>
            Heat oven to 350 degrees and line two rimmed sheet pans with 
            parchment paper. Using two spoons or a cookie scooper, plop 
            out 2-tablespoon/50-gram rounds spaced a couple of inches apart.
            (You should get about 7 to 8 cookies per sheet pan.) Place the 
            sheet pans in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until the dough 
            is no longer sticky and easier to handle. 
        </p>
            <br>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>
            While the dough chills, make the frosting: In a fine-mesh 
            sieve set over a medium bowl, sift the ground raspberries, 
            using a spoon to help pass them through, until most of the
            ruby-red powder is in the bowl and most of the seeds are left 
            behind in the sieve. (Discard the seeds.)
        </p>
            <br>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>
            To the bowl, add the 1 cup butter, confectioners’ sugar, 
            vanilla extract and salt and, with an electric hand mixer, mix 
            on low speed until the butter absorbs the sugar. Then, turn the 
            speed up to high and beat until the frosting doubles in size, 
            about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber 
            spatula to ensure all the ingredients are incorporated. Transfer
            the frosting to a small container, cover tightly, and set aside. 
            (You should have about 2 cups of frosting.)
        </p>
            <br>
    <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>
            Remove the sheet pans from the freezer. Roll the chilled 
            dough into even balls and flatten them slightly with your 
            fingers so they’re about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high. Bake
            the cookies for 13 to 15 minutes, rotating the pans and switching 
            racks halfway through, or until they no longer look wet on top,
            are still light in color and spring back to the touch. They will 
            puff up and crack slightly. Let cool completely on the sheet pan. 
            (They will continue to cook as they sit.) 
        </p>
            <br>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <p>
            Using a butter knife or offset spatula, frost each cooled 
            cookie with the raspberry frosting and adorn with the sprinkles.
        </p>
