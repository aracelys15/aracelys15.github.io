                            Mofongo is a local favorite. It's typically 
                            made with green plantains fried and mashed together
                             with oil, garlic, salt, and sometimes chicharr√≥n 
                             (fried pork skin). The mash is usually served on 
                             a plate with chicken, shrimp, beef, or vegetables.
                              Mofongo is arguably Puerto Rico's most important dish.
