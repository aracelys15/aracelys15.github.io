                                        <p>We have to start, of course, with the 
                                            national drink of Puerto Rico, the piña 
                                            colada. The origins of this signature drink
                                             are hotly debated to this day. Most 
                                             accounts agree on the fact that the drink
                                              was invented in San Juan. Some stories 
                                              claim that it was first concocted at the 
                                              Caribe Hilton Hotel in 1954 by a creative
                                               bartender. However, if you head to 
                                               Barrachina restaurant, you’ll find 
                                               a plaque at the entrance that says 
                                             this is the birthplace of the drink,
                                             where it was invented by a Spanish 
                                              mixologist in 1963.</p>

                                            Guarapo is literally translated to sugar 
                                            cane juice. The drink is made of the sugar
                                             cane sometimes mixed with fruit juice. 
                                             This is very common in Latin American 
                                             countries as sugar cane is cultivated
                                              in the Caribbean, and Central and South
